The Boston Dynamics robot dog, Spot, is a striking example of how system dynamics drives modern engineering. As an autonomous machine, it relies on rapid correction and response torques to maintain balance under challenging conditions. In the video below, you can see how Spot instantly reacts to disturbances, including unexpected pushes and uneven forces:

To explore this concept myself, I created a simplified Fusion 360 model of Spot’s leg, treating the joints as connected rigid bodies similar to a 2D pendulum system. Building and analyzing this model helped me better understand how joint motion, torque requirements, and structural relationships influence stability and control in complex robotic systems.
