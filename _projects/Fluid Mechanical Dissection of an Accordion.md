Project Description: My group conducted a fluid mechanics focused dissection and analysis of a button accordion to understand how unsteady internal airflow is converted into sound through reed vibration. By physically disassembling the instrument and mapping its internal components including the bellows, reed blocks, valves, and register mechanisms, we examined how pressure generation, flow routing, and internal losses govern both loudness and tonal quality. The project reframed a musical instrument as a coupled fluid structure system where pressure differentials created by the bellows drive turbulent jets through narrow reed chambers, exciting vibrating reeds and producing sound.

My contribution: I led the conceptual fluid mechanics analysis by modeling the accordion bellows as a variable control volume that generates a pressure rise proportional to applied force divided by bellows area. I analyzed airflow through valve openings and reed slots using Bernoulli based reasoning, with discharge coefficients used to account for losses due to turbulence, sharp turns, and flow separation within the internal chambers. I developed a qualitative model describing how time dependent flow arises from reed vibration, where the effective flow area changes dynamically and produces quasi steady but unsteady mass flow. I estimated jet velocities at the reed gaps, argued for turbulent flow regimes using Reynolds number scaling, and explained how turbulence enhances energy transfer to the reeds, increasing sound intensity. I also justified key assumptions including incompressible flow, uniform internal pressure, and quasi steady behavior, and connected reed geometry such as length and thickness to vibration frequency and pitch using simplified beam and flow excitation relationships.
