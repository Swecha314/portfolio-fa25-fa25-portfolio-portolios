n this project, we calculated the stresses and strain values of a baseline torque wrench were calculated. We were then challenged to redesign the wrench, changing the materials and lengths to satisfy safety and strain requirements. I found this project to be extremeley constructive, as I learned a new way to test the integrity of the CAD designs I create in the future.
