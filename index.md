## About Me

Hi! I’m Swecha and I’m a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I’ve had the privilege to work on projects that bring design to life- from robotics systems to sustainable engineering solutions. I’m always looking for new ways to combine creativity, problem-solving, and purposeful design to make an impact through engineering.
